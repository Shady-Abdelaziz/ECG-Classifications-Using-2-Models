# ECG Heartbeat Categorization Model Using 2 Models

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model developed for categorizing ECG (Electrocardiogram) heartbeat data in relation to Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs). The model leverages data from an Employee database to perform classification and aggregations, assisting organizations in identifying and evaluating core competencies through heartbeat analysis.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shayanfazeli/heartbeat .
- `Colab/`: [Jupyter notebooks that detail the data processing, model training, and evaluation steps](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Of8TNBl7Z0vlubzs6yhexJhtO-pCHB2R?usp=sharing).
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages to run the code.
